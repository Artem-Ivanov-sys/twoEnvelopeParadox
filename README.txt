The paradox of two envelopes

You have two envelopes;
Rule: in one of envelopes X money, in other either 2X or X/2 money.
You select one of envelopes. Let there's Y money;
Then in other envelope either 2Y or Y/2 money;
You can change envelope or take your first envelope;

If you'll always change envelope then after many changes you'll have 5X/4 money.
